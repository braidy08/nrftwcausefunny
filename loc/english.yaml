heist_nrftwcausefunny_nar_brief : "This branch of Secure Capital Bank is currently holding an unusually large amount of cash in its vault, awaiting transport. Because of this, there is an increased presence of security guards on-site, but I’m sure you can handle it.\n\nDecide the best way to approach this.
